I'm here in beautiful Raleigh, North Carolina for the second annual [Clojure/conj](http://tbd) conference. While the conference has yet to start, the training is underway and I wanted to capture some fairly random thoughts from it:

* There's an incredible mix of programmer stereotypes present in the training. Unix wizard neckbeards, gray hair "industrial / machinery" programmers, mainframe masters, mathematicians, and of course some of my fellow hepcat Ruby/Python slingers. Allow me to flagrantly make a broad generalization based on a small sampling of unfair stereotypes. I think this really speaks to the potentially wide appeal of a language like Clojure. Very interesting.
* I frequently sigh and think fondly of F#. It had a five year headstart on Clojure, and yet there's no community for F# by comparison. It's a shame - I think it's a great choice for nearly any .NET project, but Microsoft continues to position it as a niche language only to be used for hard problems or math-intensive applications. Since the .NET community subsists on officially approved projects and tools from the mothership, that's unlikely to change any time soon. (For the record though, I'm already convinced that Clojure > F#)
* Getting to listen to Stuart Halloway hold court during the training is golden. He brings such interesting perspectives and opinions, all of which are hard-earned and entertaining to boot. I've been noting choice bits whenever I hear them:
	* "The purpose of my training is not fact- or knowledge-transmission, but inspiration-transmission"
	* "I'm going to let you in on a secret - design patterns are evil." (on why Clojurists don't spend much time worrying about design patterns)
	* "Like all religions, the charismatic leader was great. The followers were the problem." (also on design patterns)
	* "The only good thing to come out of OO was polymorphism."
	* "Scheme is an interesting exercise in austerity."
	* "'Easier' is a dirty word in the Clojure community"
	* "Talking about the world in a functional way is basically impossible, so I won't. I'm going to say these functions change values, and we'll all remember that what I mean is that these functions *don't* change values, okay?"
	* "In an OO language, you have to put a lock on my motion to find my current position. As more and more people observe me, I actually move slower and slower!" (on the problems with traditional OO concurrency solutions)
	* Unrelated, but the [Strobe acquisition](http://blog.strobecorp.com/?p=304) by Facebook is interesting. I won't speculate on what that means for Facebook because I'm like your grandpa when it comes to that thingamajig. However, I'm glad to see Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz opt out of the acquisition and start their own thing. I think that speaks to the golden future ahead for SproutCore, and it would still be my framework of choice for building a rich client at the moment.
