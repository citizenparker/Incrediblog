Friday was my last day at Groupon. I will remain a tremendously big fan of [Groupon Engineering](https://engineering.groupon.com/) and the people that comprise it, but the time was right to move on.

I'm not entirely sure what's next for me. For now, taking some concentrated time off to spend time with my wife, hack on some long-suffering projects, and likely take on some part-time and/or remote work while looking for the "next big thing" in my life.

A ridiculous number of great people crossed my path at Groupon over the past years, but I want to thank a few in particular. [Kevin Taylor](https://twitter.com/ktaylor) for Obtiva, the first "big thing" for me and the company that would drastically alter the course of my career. [Dave Hoover](http://nuts.redsquirrel.com/post/29464274523/making-a-move), you continue to be my software and spiritual guru. [Shinji Kuwayama](http://kuwayama.com/) and [Richie Vos](https://twitter.com/richievos), for basically being role models to all of Groupon Engineering during my tenure. I want to grow up and be like you.

I especially want to say thanks to everyone that has been part of my teams. I looked forward to coming into work nearly every day because of you guys. In no particular order, thank you [Derrick](https://twitter.com/dcsesq/), [Jon](https://twitter.com/jonpliske/), [Surya](https://twitter.com/suryagaddipati), [Charlotte](https://twitter.com/charlotte_w_tan), [Nate](https://twitter.com/njackson), [Roshan](http://roshfu.com/), [Ben](https://twitter.com/senorduck/), [Kavita](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kavita-kochar/3/921/216), [Ryan](https://twitter.com/ryanbriones), [Sam](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/samuel-lopes/35/60b/546), Raphy, and [Peter](http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/).

Play me out, miners.

I expect big things from my friends at Groupon. Don't let me down.
