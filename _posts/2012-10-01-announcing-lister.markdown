Last week, I grew frustrated with the available options to make and share shopping lists with people. I didn't want someone to have to create an account, choose from curated selections, or any other hassle. I wanted people to make a list and instantly be able to share it with whomever they like.

So I created [Lister!](http://lister.citizenparker.com). It offers no frills, no security, and no guarantees (doubly-so as it is backed by an in-memory Redis store). But it's probably the absolute simplest way to share a list. So get listing!

If interested, Lister! is written in Clojure and the source is available at [github.com/citizenparker/lister](http://www.github.com/citizenparker/lister). There's a bevy of problems in the code and in the app (the HTML5 features I use aren't supported in Android, most frustratingly for me) but it will have to wait a bit.

Enjoy!
