title: Planning to Plan
the point: I'm making a plan. That's out of character for me. Don't know what to think of it.

The last plan for my career led me to dropping out of a PhD program rather spectacularly. Ever since I've unconsciously avoided such long-term plans and instead focused on whatever interested me at the moment. This strategic lack of strategy has been incredibly successful so far and brought me some [very](http://www.obtiva.com/culture) [good](http://www.groupon.com) [things](http://groups.google.com/group/chisc). Strangely, it also helps in identifying opportunities, as some things are easier to see when you're not looking for them.

In other words, avoiding any definite long-term plans has been a very good plan so far.

The problem with interests is that they have an awful tendency to lead to ideas, and those ideas to plans. That's where I find myself now. For some time, I've been interested in all the ways software organizations react to change. Change in their growth, in their mission, or in their structure. It's something we developers seem to think about without really grasping how these fundamental organizational strategies impact our success on a daily basis.

So this is a topic that interests me, and one wherein there's a good amount of opportunity to be found. We'll see where this takes me, but I think it's safe to say some plans are coming together.

Wierd!
