Huzzah! In roughly 3.5 hours, [Ludum Dare 24](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/) will begin. I'll be participating again in the loosest sense of the word. As with [my "game" for LD23](https://github.com/citizenparker/the-two-of-us), I am going into this deliberately unfamiliar with the frameworks I'll be using. Any ideas you may have about "fun", "playable", or "complete" should be checked at the door.

If you have any interest or background in programming, I strongly encourage you to [participate](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/rules/). If you set aside all goals except "do your best" this is a tremendously fun event. Anyone of any background can participate.

I'll be writing my entry in Clojure and libgdx this time around. I'm excited for a couple of reasons. First, this will be my first opportunity to play with [LightTable](http://app.kodowa.com/) (pictured above) on a real project. Most importantly though, game programming is typically the poster child of mutated state - nearly every element you see when playing a game mutates-in-place over time. I'm very curious to see how well or poorly I can translate Clojure to this domain.

If you want the gory details on my progress, you can find that on [scoopsy.com](http://scoopsy.com). Otherwise I'll post a summary eventually.

TO THE CODES!
