Last night I spent some time to dig into this fascinating article by Martin Fowler on [the LMAX platform](http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html). You should get yourself a nice long chunk of time and read it, really.

It's an incredible project, one that audaciously challenges many long-held assumptions about how to build software in our modern age. It's the product of an incredible team who truly distilled their requirements into an incredible platform.

It's awe-inspiring. One of the best articles I've read in a long time. Someday, I'll be in the opportunity and have the technical expertise to help build something like that. It will be great, and I hope you're there too.

Seriously, [go read it](http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html).

**Update** - Turns out that a decent chunk of that project has been open sourced. You can look at the [disruptor code here](http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/).
