<p>Just wanted to take a moment and capture some random thoughts about MadisonRuby.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks everyone</strong> who came to my talk today at <a href="http://madisonruby.org">MadisonRuby</a>. This has been a tremendous conference so far and I&rsquo;m honored to be a part of it. Slides for my talk, &ldquo;Building the Great Wall: API Driven Applications&rdquo; are available at <a href="http://great-wall.heroku.com">great-wall.heroku.com</a>. If you have any follow-up questions about that talk, I&rsquo;d love to continue the conversation. Feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/citizenparker">find me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Madison is</strong> perhaps the loveliest town I&rsquo;ve ever been to. Although I&rsquo;m not sure I get the whole cheese thing. I&rsquo;ve spent a fair amount of time elsewhere in Wisconsin and so I&rsquo;m familiar with cheesemania. However, Madison takes this to a whole new level. My heart no longer pumps but instead goes &ldquo;squelch&rdquo; every so often.</p>

<p><strong>Special moments</strong> abound at this conference. It&rsquo;s an incredible conference with a special ethos - lots of hugs and affection everywhere. Sometimes I forget there&rsquo;s special connections everywhere in the Ruby community.  It&rsquo;s such a marvelous experience, thanks guys. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jremsikjr">Big Tiger</a> in particular, you&rsquo;ve been totally awesome. I am in your debt for these moments.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve included</strong> some of my favorite MadisonRuby moments below courtesy of <a href="http://twip.us">twip.us</a> - you can view their entire <a href="/photos/madison-ruby-2011">MadisonRuby collection here</a>.</p>

    <section class="post-date">Thursday, August 11, 2011</section>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31246066@N04/4246350621/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/street_lamps.jpg" title="&quot;Light Unto My Path&quot; by Ian Sane" alt="&quot;Light Unto My Path&quot; by Ian Sane" /></a></p>

<p>A hundred years ago, lighting lamps was a great way to earn a living. You&rsquo;d carry around a giant pole and go from lamp to lamp lighting them up. See the city while starting fires, I can see the appeal. Many others did too and created a rich set of traditions, practices, and quirks.</p>

<p>Things changed without advance warning though. We figured out how to make gas lamps light themselves and a profession was extinct. A dedicated few kept it alive through <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/djk12/images/Poland%20Trip%20Pix/pages/733%20Lamplighter%20in%20Lazienki%20Park_jpg.htm">sheer force of will</a> but by and large lamplighting was dead even before the advent of electricity.</p>

<p>Such is the danger of specialization, a horribly easy trap to fall into. It&rsquo;s tempting to focus your energies on improving the process of using long sticks to ignite lamps. However, it&rsquo;s career suicide to forget that your customers want light, not sticks.</p>

<p>Bringers of light will never go out of fashion, but the demand for people with sticks is always a time-limited affair<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Be very careful about tying yourself to just one way to set things on fire.</p>

  <h2><a href="/posts/2011-08-05-obtiva">obtiva </a></h2>
    <section class="post-date">Friday, August 05, 2011</section>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/3336/161072974/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/tunnels.jpg" title="&quot;Inscope Arch&quot; by Diego3336" alt="&quot;Inscope Arch&quot; by Diego3336" /></a></p>

<p>People who practice various forms of agile software development often make distinctions between capital-A “Agile” as a set of defined practices and methodologies, and “agile” as a broader philosophy of how to approach software. Bill Pietri <a href="http://agilefocus.com/2009/02/06/agile-versus-agile/">sums it up best</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important to note that they weren’t saying that they had an exclusive lock on agility, or even what made software development agile. As with the naming of Grand Rapids, they were pointing at a particular spot in the landscape of ideas and naming it. The word agile has a variety of meanings, and there are a lot of aspects to software development to which you could apply those meanings. They weren’t trying to lay claim to agility as a whole, any more than Grand Rapids is claiming all the rapids in the world, especially the grand ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yesterday, the organization called Obtiva by those who worked there <a href="http://www.groupon.com/blog/cities/we-call-it-grouptiva-groupon-acquires-obtiva/">was acquired by Groupon</a>. Just as agile practitioners differentiate between “Agile” and “agile” though, a similar distinction must be made here. While it’s true that this chapter in the history of Obtiva ends, it’s equally true that lowercase-o “obtiva” will continue to exist beyond this organization and even the people who comprised it. </p>

<p>This obtiva is present each time we build software with an empathetic view towards those in need of it. When one developer invests in another at the cost of their personal time and productivity, this obtiva is at work. Engaging with the larger community when there’s no personal gain is totally obtiva.</p>

<p>While I will stop calling myself an Obtivian, I have been extremely fortunate to practice obtiva daily with my friends and colleagues for nearly two years, and I look forward to many more. This is an opportunity to create and find much more obtiva in the world, and I am certain I will continue to share in obtiva with friends both old and new.</p>

<p>It has always been and will always be a great time to be obtiva.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who made it possible for me to share in all things Obtiva. I especially appreciate Kevin Taylor, Kat Nelson-Reid, Dave Hoover, and Todd Webb for deciding to take a chance on me and my “top-secret plan” to join them. This company has been a second family to me in times both tremendous and terrible, and I will always value that.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/visentico/4622980574/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/tilt-shift-garden.jpg" title="&quot;Powerscourt : Tiltshift&quot; by Visentico / Sento" alt="&quot;Powerscourt : Tiltshift&quot; by Visentico / Sento" /></a></p>

<p>Last night I spent some time to dig into this fascinating article by Martin Fowler on <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html">the LMAX platform</a>. You should get yourself a nice long chunk of time and read it, really.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible project, one that audaciously challenges many long-held assumptions about how to build software in our modern age. It&rsquo;s the product of an incredible team who truly distilled their requirements into an incredible platform.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s awe-inspiring. One of the best articles I&rsquo;ve read in a long time. Someday, I&rsquo;ll be in the opportunity and have the technical expertise to help build something like that. It will be great, and I hope you&rsquo;re there too.</p>

<p>Seriously, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html">go read it</a>.</p>

<p>-SP</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> - Turns out that a decent chunk of that project has been open sourced. You can look at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/">disruptor code here</a>.</p>

  <h2><a href="/posts/2011-07-11-chisc-processes-patterns">ChiSC Meeting - 7/20 - "Processes & Patterns" </a></h2>
    <section class="post-date">Monday, July 11, 2011</section>
    <p><strong>We’re in need of a venue for this meeting - if your know of a place in the Loop that could help, please <a href="/contact">contact me</a></strong></p>

<p>We’re all familiar with words like “process” and “patterns” - in this meeting, we’ll look at different ways to think about and apply those terms in ways you may not expect.</p>

<p>Groupon’s <strong>Blake Smith</strong> will begin by examining why design patterns lead to good designs at the small-scale program level, why they often get ignored at the macro large-scale system level, and the impacts of doing so on your applications. </p>

<p>Then we’ll switch gears and go through a group exercise on understanding why your employer, (yes, <em>your</em> employer) has the process it does and how that impacts you. As with the previous exercises, this could be a huge success or huge failure but should be entertaining either way.</p>

<p><strong>As always, anyone of any experience level and any background is welcome to come and participate.</strong></p>

<p>Food and socialization will begin at 6PM on Wednesday, July 20th, and we’ll the start the meeting a bit after that. Once we’re done, we’ll wander on down the street to socialize and intoxify.</p>

<p>If you’re interested, <a href="http://chisc.gathers.us/events/chicago-software-craftsmanship-processes-patterns">please RSVP here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Both portions be interactive, so please come ready to participate.</strong></p>

<p>To stay informed on what’s happening with ChiSC, please join the mailing list at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chisc">http://groups.google.com/group/chisc</a></p>

<p>See you there!
