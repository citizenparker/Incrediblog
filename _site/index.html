    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/calsidyrose/4925267732/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/compass.jpg" title="&quot;Compass Study&quot; by Calsidyrose" alt="&quot;Compass Study&quot; by Calsidyrose" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m here in beautiful Raleigh, North Carolina for the second annual <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a> conference. While the conference has yet to start, the training is underway and I wanted to capture some fairly random thoughts from it:</p>

<p><strong>Rainbows</strong> - There&rsquo;s an incredible mix of programmer stereotypes present in the training. Unix wizard neckbeards, gray hair &ldquo;industrial machinery&rdquo; programmers, mainframe masters, mathematicians, and of course some of my fellow hepcat Ruby/Python slingers. Allow me to flagrantly make a broad generalization based on a small sampling of unfair stereotypes: This speaks to the  very broad appeal of Clojure. Something interesting could be happening in this community.</p>

<p><strong>Whither F#?</strong> - I frequently sigh and think fondly of F#. It had a five year headstart on Clojure, and yet there&rsquo;s no community for F# by comparison. It&rsquo;s a shame - I think it&rsquo;s a great choice for nearly any .NET project, but Microsoft continues to position it as a niche language only to be used for hard problems or math-intensive applications. Since the .NET community subsists on officially approved projects and tools from the mothership, that&rsquo;s unlikely to change any time soon. I&rsquo;d still pick Clojure over F# for most anything, but I feel for my .NET brethren who are unknowingly living in the dark ages.</p>

<p><strong>Stuart Halloway</strong> - Getting to listen to Stuart Halloway hold court during the training is golden. He brings such interesting perspectives and opinions, all of which are hard-earned and entertaining to boot. I&rsquo;ve been noting choice bits whenever I hear them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;The purpose of my training is not fact- or knowledge-transmission, but inspiration-transmission&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let you in on a secret - design patterns are evil.&rdquo; (on why Clojurists don&rsquo;t spend much time worrying about design patterns)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Like all religions, the charismatic leader was great. The followers were the problem.&rdquo; (also on design patterns)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;The only good thing to come out of OO was polymorphism.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Scheme is an interesting exercise in austerity.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Easier&rsquo; is a dirty word in the Clojure community&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Talking about the world in a functional way is basically impossible, so I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to say these functions change values, and we&rsquo;ll all remember that what I mean is that these functions <em>don&rsquo;t</em> change values, okay?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;In an OO language, you have to put a lock on my motion to find my current position. As more and more people observe me, I actually move slower and slower!&rdquo; (on the problems with traditional OO concurrency solutions)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unrelated</strong> - The <a href="http://blog.strobecorp.com/?p=304">Strobe acquisition</a> by Facebook is interesting. I won&rsquo;t speculate on what that means for Facebook because I&rsquo;m like your grandpa when it comes to that thingamajig. However, I&rsquo;m glad to see Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz opt out of the acquisition and start their own thing. I think that speaks to the golden future ahead for SproutCore, and it would still be my framework of choice for building a rich client at the moment.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wonderlane/4242150313/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/lightsplosion.jpg" title="&quot;Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by anything.&quot; by Wonderlane" alt="&quot;Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by anything.&quot; by Wonderlane" /></a></p>

<p>I spent some quality time this weekend digging into a few presentations that I thought I&rsquo;d share with you.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/737-rubyconf2011-lightning-talk-let-s-go-to-shibuya-rubyist-lunch-at-tokyo-japan">Shibuya Rubyist Lunch lightning talk</a> from RubyConf 2011. It&rsquo;s short, about three minutes, and will set the right tone for what&rsquo;s to come. You can&rsquo;t help but feel joy when you see the enthusiasm of the audience and speaker for one another. This video encapsulates why I love the Ruby community dearly.</p>

<p>Rich Hickey&rsquo;s talk from Strange Loop 2011, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a>,&rdquo; is the best presentation I&rsquo;ve seen in years. Rich makes the case that we have abandoned the concept of &ldquo;simple&rdquo; entirely in a slavish pursuit of &ldquo;easy.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s incredibly thought-provoking - see Uncle Bob&rsquo;s follow-up, for instance. It also gives the best context yet for Rich&rsquo;s disregard for testing. Definitely have to watch this sometime - it&rsquo;s already given us a new word, &ldquo;complect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Also from this year&rsquo;s Strange Loop is Nathan Marz with <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Storm">an overview of the new Storm framework</a>. This platform for distributed real-time computation looks incredibly promising. I need to dig into this further, but this could potentially solve many different problems I&rsquo;m looking at today. It&rsquo;s not quite the brain-burner that Rich&rsquo;s talk can be, so it makes a wonderful &ldquo;cool-down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What about you? Seen any great talks lately? Planning for attending Strange Loop 2012 already?</p>

<p>Just wanted to take a moment and capture some random thoughts about MadisonRuby.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks everyone</strong> who came to my talk today at <a href="http://madisonruby.org">MadisonRuby</a>. This has been a tremendous conference so far and I&rsquo;m honored to be a part of it. Slides for my talk, &ldquo;Building the Great Wall: API Driven Applications&rdquo; are available at <a href="http://great-wall.heroku.com">great-wall.heroku.com</a>. If you have any follow-up questions about that talk, I&rsquo;d love to continue the conversation. Feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/citizenparker">find me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Madison is</strong> perhaps the loveliest town I&rsquo;ve ever been to. Although I&rsquo;m not sure I get the whole cheese thing. I&rsquo;ve spent a fair amount of time elsewhere in Wisconsin and so I&rsquo;m familiar with cheesemania. However, Madison takes this to a whole new level. My heart no longer pumps but instead goes &ldquo;squelch&rdquo; every so often.</p>

<p><strong>Special moments</strong> abound at this conference. It&rsquo;s an incredible conference with a special ethos - lots of hugs and affection everywhere. Sometimes I forget there&rsquo;s special connections everywhere in the Ruby community.  It&rsquo;s such a marvelous experience, thanks guys. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jremsikjr">Big Tiger</a> in particular, you&rsquo;ve been totally awesome. I am in your debt for these moments.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve included</strong> some of my favorite MadisonRuby moments below courtesy of <a href="http://twip.us">twip.us</a> - you can view their entire <a href="http://twip.us/madison-ruby-2011">MadisonRuby collection here</a>.</p>

    <section class="post-date">Thursday, August 11, 2011</section>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31246066@N04/4246350621/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/street_lamps.jpg" title="&quot;Light Unto My Path&quot; by Ian Sane" alt="&quot;Light Unto My Path&quot; by Ian Sane" /></a></p>

<p>A hundred years ago, lighting lamps was a great way to earn a living. You&rsquo;d carry around a giant pole and go from lamp to lamp lighting them up. See the city while starting fires, I can see the appeal. Many others did too and created a rich set of traditions, practices, and quirks.</p>

<p>Things changed without advance warning though. We figured out how to make gas lamps light themselves and a profession was extinct. A dedicated few kept it alive through <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/djk12/images/Poland%20Trip%20Pix/pages/733%20Lamplighter%20in%20Lazienki%20Park_jpg.htm">sheer force of will</a> but by and large lamplighting was dead even before the advent of electricity.</p>

<p>Such is the danger of specialization, a horribly easy trap to fall into. It&rsquo;s tempting to focus your energies on improving the process of using long sticks to ignite lamps. However, it&rsquo;s career suicide to forget that your customers want light, not sticks.</p>

<p>Bringers of light will never go out of fashion, but the demand for people with sticks is always a time-limited affair<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Be very careful about tying yourself to just one way to set things on fire.</p>

  <h2><a href="/posts/2011-08-05-obtiva">obtiva </a></h2>
    <section class="post-date">Friday, August 05, 2011</section>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/3336/161072974/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/tunnels.jpg" title="&quot;Inscope Arch&quot; by Diego3336" alt="&quot;Inscope Arch&quot; by Diego3336" /></a></p>

<p>People who practice various forms of agile software development often make distinctions between capital-A “Agile” as a set of defined practices and methodologies, and “agile” as a broader philosophy of how to approach software. Bill Pietri <a href="http://agilefocus.com/2009/02/06/agile-versus-agile/">sums it up best</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important to note that they weren’t saying that they had an exclusive lock on agility, or even what made software development agile. As with the naming of Grand Rapids, they were pointing at a particular spot in the landscape of ideas and naming it. The word agile has a variety of meanings, and there are a lot of aspects to software development to which you could apply those meanings. They weren’t trying to lay claim to agility as a whole, any more than Grand Rapids is claiming all the rapids in the world, especially the grand ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yesterday, the organization called Obtiva by those who worked there <a href="http://www.groupon.com/blog/cities/we-call-it-grouptiva-groupon-acquires-obtiva/">was acquired by Groupon</a>. Just as agile practitioners differentiate between “Agile” and “agile” though, a similar distinction must be made here. While it’s true that this chapter in the history of Obtiva ends, it’s equally true that lowercase-o “obtiva” will continue to exist beyond this organization and even the people who comprised it. </p>

<p>This obtiva is present each time we build software with an empathetic view towards those in need of it. When one developer invests in another at the cost of their personal time and productivity, this obtiva is at work. Engaging with the larger community when there’s no personal gain is totally obtiva.</p>

<p>While I will stop calling myself an Obtivian, I have been extremely fortunate to practice obtiva daily with my friends and colleagues for nearly two years, and I look forward to many more. This is an opportunity to create and find much more obtiva in the world, and I am certain I will continue to share in obtiva with friends both old and new.</p>

<p>It has always been and will always be a great time to be obtiva.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who made it possible for me to share in all things Obtiva. I especially appreciate Kevin Taylor, Kat Nelson-Reid, Dave Hoover, and Todd Webb for deciding to take a chance on me and my “top-secret plan” to join them. This company has been a second family to me in times both tremendous and terrible, and I will always value that.</p>
