<p>Friday was my last day at Groupon. I will remain a tremendously big fan of <a href="https://engineering.groupon.com/">Groupon Engineering</a> and the people that comprise it, but the time was right to move on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what&rsquo;s next for me. For now, taking some concentrated time off to spend time with my wife, hack on some long-suffering projects, and likely take on some part-time and/or remote work while looking for the &ldquo;next big thing&rdquo; in my life.</p>

<p>A ridiculous number of great people crossed my path at Groupon over the past years, but I want to thank a few in particular. <a href="https://twitter.com/ktaylor">Kevin Taylor</a> for Obtiva, the first &ldquo;big thing&rdquo; for me and the company that would drastically alter the course of my career. <a href="http://nuts.redsquirrel.com/post/29464274523/making-a-move">Dave Hoover</a>, you continue to be my software and spiritual guru. <a href="http://kuwayama.com/">Shinji Kuwayama</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/richievos">Richie Vos</a>, for basically being role models to all of Groupon Engineering during my tenure. I want to grow up and be like you.</p>

<p>I especially want to say thanks to everyone that has been part of my teams. I looked forward to coming into work nearly every day because of you guys. In no particular order, thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/dcsesq/">Derrick</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonpliske/">Jon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/suryagaddipati">Surya</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/charlotte_w_tan">Charlotte</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/njackson">Nate</a>, <a href="http://roshfu.com/">Roshan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/senorduck/">Ben</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kavita-kochar/3/921/216">Kavita</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbriones">Ryan</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/samuel-lopes/35/60b/546">Sam</a>, Raphy, and <a href="http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/">Peter</a>.</p>

<p>Play me out, miners.</p>

<p>I expect big things from my friends at Groupon. Don&rsquo;t let me down.

    <section class="post-date">Tuesday, November 08, 2011</section>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/calsidyrose/4925267732/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/compass.jpg" title="&quot;Compass Study&quot; by Calsidyrose" alt="&quot;Compass Study&quot; by Calsidyrose" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m here in beautiful Raleigh, North Carolina for the second annual <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a> conference. While the conference has yet to start, the training is underway and I wanted to capture some fairly random thoughts from it:</p>

<p><strong>Rainbows</strong> - There&rsquo;s an incredible mix of programmer stereotypes present in the training. Unix wizard neckbeards, gray hair &ldquo;industrial machinery&rdquo; programmers, mainframe masters, mathematicians, and of course some of my fellow hepcat Ruby/Python slingers. Allow me to flagrantly make a broad generalization based on a small sampling of unfair stereotypes: This speaks to the  very broad appeal of Clojure. Something interesting could be happening in this community.</p>

<p><strong>Whither F#?</strong> - I frequently sigh and think fondly of F#. It had a five year headstart on Clojure, and yet there&rsquo;s no community for F# by comparison. It&rsquo;s a shame - I think it&rsquo;s a great choice for nearly any .NET project, but Microsoft continues to position it as a niche language only to be used for hard problems or math-intensive applications. Since the .NET community subsists on officially approved projects and tools from the mothership, that&rsquo;s unlikely to change any time soon. I&rsquo;d still pick Clojure over F# for most anything, but I feel for my .NET brethren who are unknowingly living in the dark ages.</p>

<p><strong>Stuart Halloway</strong> - Getting to listen to Stuart Halloway hold court during the training is golden. He brings such interesting perspectives and opinions, all of which are hard-earned and entertaining to boot. I&rsquo;ve been noting choice bits whenever I hear them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;The purpose of my training is not fact- or knowledge-transmission, but inspiration-transmission&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let you in on a secret - design patterns are evil.&rdquo; (on why Clojurists don&rsquo;t spend much time worrying about design patterns)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Like all religions, the charismatic leader was great. The followers were the problem.&rdquo; (also on design patterns)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;The only good thing to come out of OO was polymorphism.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Scheme is an interesting exercise in austerity.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Easier&rsquo; is a dirty word in the Clojure community&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Talking about the world in a functional way is basically impossible, so I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to say these functions change values, and we&rsquo;ll all remember that what I mean is that these functions <em>don&rsquo;t</em> change values, okay?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;In an OO language, you have to put a lock on my motion to find my current position. As more and more people observe me, I actually move slower and slower!&rdquo; (on the problems with traditional OO concurrency solutions)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unrelated</strong> - The <a href="http://blog.strobecorp.com/?p=304">Strobe acquisition</a> by Facebook is interesting. I won&rsquo;t speculate on what that means for Facebook because I&rsquo;m like your grandpa when it comes to that thingamajig. However, I&rsquo;m glad to see Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz opt out of the acquisition and start their own thing. I think that speaks to the golden future ahead for SproutCore, and it would still be my framework of choice for building a rich client at the moment.</p>

  <h2><a href="/posts/2011-10-24-great-presentations">Great Presentations </a></h2>
    <section class="post-date">Monday, October 24, 2011</section>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wonderlane/4242150313/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/lightsplosion.jpg" title="&quot;Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by anything.&quot; by Wonderlane" alt="&quot;Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by anything.&quot; by Wonderlane" /></a></p>

<p>I spent some quality time this weekend digging into a few presentations that I thought I&rsquo;d share with you.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/737-rubyconf2011-lightning-talk-let-s-go-to-shibuya-rubyist-lunch-at-tokyo-japan">Shibuya Rubyist Lunch lightning talk</a> from RubyConf 2011. It&rsquo;s short, about three minutes, and will set the right tone for what&rsquo;s to come. You can&rsquo;t help but feel joy when you see the enthusiasm of the audience and speaker for one another. This video encapsulates why I love the Ruby community dearly.</p>

<p>Rich Hickey&rsquo;s talk from Strange Loop 2011, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a>,&rdquo; is the best presentation I&rsquo;ve seen in years. Rich makes the case that we have abandoned the concept of &ldquo;simple&rdquo; entirely in a slavish pursuit of &ldquo;easy.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s incredibly thought-provoking - see Uncle Bob&rsquo;s follow-up, for instance. It also gives the best context yet for Rich&rsquo;s disregard for testing. Definitely have to watch this sometime - it&rsquo;s already given us a new word, &ldquo;complect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Also from this year&rsquo;s Strange Loop is Nathan Marz with <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Storm">an overview of the new Storm framework</a>. This platform for distributed real-time computation looks incredibly promising. I need to dig into this further, but this could potentially solve many different problems I&rsquo;m looking at today. It&rsquo;s not quite the brain-burner that Rich&rsquo;s talk can be, so it makes a wonderful &ldquo;cool-down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What about you? Seen any great talks lately? Planning for attending Strange Loop 2012 already?</p>

<p>Just wanted to take a moment and capture some random thoughts about MadisonRuby.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks everyone</strong> who came to my talk today at <a href="http://madisonruby.org">MadisonRuby</a>. This has been a tremendous conference so far and I&rsquo;m honored to be a part of it. Slides for my talk, &ldquo;Building the Great Wall: API Driven Applications&rdquo; are available at <a href="http://great-wall.heroku.com">great-wall.heroku.com</a>. If you have any follow-up questions about that talk, I&rsquo;d love to continue the conversation. Feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/citizenparker">find me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Madison is</strong> perhaps the loveliest town I&rsquo;ve ever been to. Although I&rsquo;m not sure I get the whole cheese thing. I&rsquo;ve spent a fair amount of time elsewhere in Wisconsin and so I&rsquo;m familiar with cheesemania. However, Madison takes this to a whole new level. My heart no longer pumps but instead goes &ldquo;squelch&rdquo; every so often.</p>

<p><strong>Special moments</strong> abound at this conference. It&rsquo;s an incredible conference with a special ethos - lots of hugs and affection everywhere. Sometimes I forget there&rsquo;s special connections everywhere in the Ruby community.  It&rsquo;s such a marvelous experience, thanks guys. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jremsikjr">Big Tiger</a> in particular, you&rsquo;ve been totally awesome. I am in your debt for these moments.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve included</strong> some of my favorite MadisonRuby moments below courtesy of <a href="http://twip.us">twip.us</a> - you can view their entire <a href="http://twip.us/madison-ruby-2011">MadisonRuby collection here</a>.</p>

    <section class="post-date">Thursday, August 11, 2011</section>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31246066@N04/4246350621/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/street_lamps.jpg" title="&quot;Light Unto My Path&quot; by Ian Sane" alt="&quot;Light Unto My Path&quot; by Ian Sane" /></a></p>

<p>A hundred years ago, lighting lamps was a great way to earn a living. You&rsquo;d carry around a giant pole and go from lamp to lamp lighting them up. See the city while starting fires, I can see the appeal. Many others did too and created a rich set of traditions, practices, and quirks.</p>

<p>Things changed without advance warning though. We figured out how to make gas lamps light themselves and a profession was extinct. A dedicated few kept it alive through <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/djk12/images/Poland%20Trip%20Pix/pages/733%20Lamplighter%20in%20Lazienki%20Park_jpg.htm">sheer force of will</a> but by and large lamplighting was dead even before the advent of electricity.</p>

<p>Such is the danger of specialization, a horribly easy trap to fall into. It&rsquo;s tempting to focus your energies on improving the process of using long sticks to ignite lamps. However, it&rsquo;s career suicide to forget that your customers want light, not sticks.</p>

<p>Bringers of light will never go out of fashion, but the demand for people with sticks is always a time-limited affair<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Be very careful about tying yourself to just one way to set things on fire.</p>
