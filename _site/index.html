  <h2><a href="/posts/2012-08-31-thoughts-on-leadership">Thoughts on Leadership </a></h2>
    <section class="post-date">Friday, August 31, 2012</section>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/3664680772"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/cutting_wheat.jpg" title="&quot;Cutting the Wheat&quot; by Trey Ratcliff" alt="&quot;Cutting the Wheat&quot; by Trey Ratcliff" /></a></p>

<p>A few people have sought my advice lately on leadership. Specifically, I&rsquo;ve gotten high marks for delivering while also giving people freedom to work as they see fit. While I would caution anyone against cargo culting my practices as yours, I&rsquo;m happy to share what little I know. </p>

<p>Be advised - I don&rsquo;t pretend to be a master, merely a student.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>Beyond business strategy (which is outside the scope of this article), the goals of leadership are primarily <strong>reducing turnover</strong> and <strong>increasing productivity</strong>. Of course there&rsquo;s a number of other secondary goals that are crucially important, like fostering a great company culture and happy employees. However, I view those first two as preconditions or boons for nearly every other goal you may have.</p>

<h3 id="randsian-philopsophy">Randsian Philopsophy</h3>

<p>You can&rsquo;t do much better than making sure you pass <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2011/10/11/the_rands_test.html">the Rands Test</a>. Seriously, go read that right now. I&rsquo;m about to expand on a couple of his points, the two I see as the absolute bare minimum for a leader.</p>

<p>1:1 meetings may be the single most important thing you can do as a leader. Not only do you get an opportunity to address problems before they become <em>problems</em>, but they help make for super-motivated employees. When individuals can speak up and can collectively see a difference, this leads to a variety of positive outcomes, especially in preventing turnover (see <a href="http://orgsci.journal.informs.org/content/early/2012/03/15/orsc.1110.0732.abstract">&ldquo;Speaking Up vs. Being Heard: The Disagreement Around and Outcomes of Employee Voice&rdquo;</a> for more details). It&rsquo;s also an opportunity each week to relate an employee&rsquo;s personal goals to the group&rsquo;s goals and thus boost personal investment in the work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also crucial that each member of the group understands the overall mission and their role within that. This speaks somewhat to motivation, but is generally a huge productivity boost. The reason comes down to initiative.</p>

<p>Harvard Business Review&rsquo;s classic article &ldquo;<a href="http://hbr.org/product/management-time-who-s-got-the-monkey/an/99609-PDF-ENG">Who&rsquo;s Got The Monkey</a>&rdquo; (paywall w/ <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-11-26/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey-businessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice">summation here</a>) outlines the following levels of employee freedom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your employees can exercise five levels of initiative in handling on-the-job problems. From lowest to highest, the levels are:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Wait until told what to do.</li>
    <li>Ask what to do.</li>
    <li>Recommend an action, then with your approval, implement it.</li>
    <li>Take independent action but advise you at once. </li>
    <li>Take independent action and update you through routine procedure.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>For maximal productivity, you want your employees to operate at the last three levels. However, they can&rsquo;t do this effectively without a great understanding of the mission and how they play into it. Reinforcing this at every opportunity (team meetings, status updates, etc.) keeps them at those higher, more productive levels.</p>

<h2 id="two-golden-rules">Two Golden Rules</h2>

<p>When all else fails, I fall back on these two maxims: &ldquo;<strong>Manage others as I would want to be managed</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>Unblocking my team is priority #1</strong>.&rdquo; When I&rsquo;m in unknown territory, I try to imagine how I would want my own managers to treat me and go from there. I also make clear to my teams that no meeting or other priority is so important that it trumps helping them. Not only does that help keep people immediately productive, but it&rsquo;s also a motivation boost to see your team lead drop everything to help debug a problem when you are truly stuck.</p>

<h2 id="useful">Useful?</h2>

<p>Anyway, if you find this useful, please do <a href="http://spparker.com/contact.html">let me know</a> and I can write a few more on the subject.</p>

<p>Huzzah! In roughly 3.5 hours, <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/">Ludum Dare 24</a> will begin. I&rsquo;ll be participating again in the loosest sense of the word. As with <a href="https://github.com/citizenparker/the-two-of-us">my &ldquo;game&rdquo; for LD23</a>, I am going into this deliberately unfamiliar with the frameworks I&rsquo;ll be using. Any ideas you may have about &ldquo;fun&rdquo;, &ldquo;playable&rdquo;, or &ldquo;complete&rdquo; should be checked at the door.</p>

<p>If you have any interest or background in programming, I strongly encourage you to <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/rules/">participate</a>. If you set aside all goals except &ldquo;do your best&rdquo; this is a tremendously fun event. Anyone of any background can participate.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be writing my entry in Clojure and libgdx this time around. I&rsquo;m excited for a couple of reasons. First, this will be my first opportunity to play with <a href="http://app.kodowa.com/">LightTable</a> (pictured above) on a real project. Most importantly though, game programming is typically the poster child of mutated state - nearly every element you see when playing a game mutates-in-place over time. I&rsquo;m very curious to see how well or poorly I can translate Clojure to this domain.</p>

<p>If you want the gory details on my progress, you can find that on <a href="http://scoopsy.com">scoopsy.com</a>. Otherwise I&rsquo;ll post a summary eventually.</p>

<p>TO THE CODES!</p>

<p>Friday was my last day at Groupon. I will remain a tremendously big fan of <a href="https://engineering.groupon.com/">Groupon Engineering</a> and the people that comprise it, but the time was right to move on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what&rsquo;s next for me. For now, taking some concentrated time off to spend time with my wife, hack on some long-suffering projects, and likely take on some part-time and/or remote work while looking for the &ldquo;next big thing&rdquo; in my life.</p>

<p>A ridiculous number of great people crossed my path at Groupon over the past years, but I want to thank a few in particular. <a href="https://twitter.com/ktaylor">Kevin Taylor</a> for Obtiva, the first &ldquo;big thing&rdquo; for me and the company that would drastically alter the course of my career. <a href="http://nuts.redsquirrel.com/post/29464274523/making-a-move">Dave Hoover</a>, you continue to be my software and spiritual guru. <a href="http://kuwayama.com/">Shinji Kuwayama</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/richievos">Richie Vos</a>, for basically being role models to all of Groupon Engineering during my tenure. I want to grow up and be like you.</p>

<p>I especially want to say thanks to everyone that has been part of my teams. I looked forward to coming into work nearly every day because of you guys. In no particular order, thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/dcsesq/">Derrick</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonpliske/">Jon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/suryagaddipati">Surya</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/charlotte_w_tan">Charlotte</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/njackson">Nate</a>, <a href="http://roshfu.com/">Roshan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/senorduck/">Ben</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kavita-kochar/3/921/216">Kavita</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbriones">Ryan</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/samuel-lopes/35/60b/546">Sam</a>, Raphy, and <a href="http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/">Peter</a>.</p>

<p>Play me out, miners.</p>

<p>I expect big things from my friends at Groupon. Don&rsquo;t let me down.</p>

  <h2><a href="/posts/2011-11-08-clojureconj-miscellany">(clojure/conj misc) </a></h2>
    <section class="post-date">Tuesday, November 08, 2011</section>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/calsidyrose/4925267732/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/compass.jpg" title="&quot;Compass Study&quot; by Calsidyrose" alt="&quot;Compass Study&quot; by Calsidyrose" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m here in beautiful Raleigh, North Carolina for the second annual <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a> conference. While the conference has yet to start, the training is underway and I wanted to capture some fairly random thoughts from it:</p>

<p><strong>Rainbows</strong> - There&rsquo;s an incredible mix of programmer stereotypes present in the training. Unix wizard neckbeards, gray hair &ldquo;industrial machinery&rdquo; programmers, mainframe masters, mathematicians, and of course some of my fellow hepcat Ruby/Python slingers. Allow me to flagrantly make a broad generalization based on a small sampling of unfair stereotypes: This speaks to the  very broad appeal of Clojure. Something interesting could be happening in this community.</p>

<p><strong>Whither F#?</strong> - I frequently sigh and think fondly of F#. It had a five year headstart on Clojure, and yet there&rsquo;s no community for F# by comparison. It&rsquo;s a shame - I think it&rsquo;s a great choice for nearly any .NET project, but Microsoft continues to position it as a niche language only to be used for hard problems or math-intensive applications. Since the .NET community subsists on officially approved projects and tools from the mothership, that&rsquo;s unlikely to change any time soon. I&rsquo;d still pick Clojure over F# for most anything, but I feel for my .NET brethren who are unknowingly living in the dark ages.</p>

<p><strong>Stuart Halloway</strong> - Getting to listen to Stuart Halloway hold court during the training is golden. He brings such interesting perspectives and opinions, all of which are hard-earned and entertaining to boot. I&rsquo;ve been noting choice bits whenever I hear them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;The purpose of my training is not fact- or knowledge-transmission, but inspiration-transmission&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let you in on a secret - design patterns are evil.&rdquo; (on why Clojurists don&rsquo;t spend much time worrying about design patterns)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Like all religions, the charismatic leader was great. The followers were the problem.&rdquo; (also on design patterns)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;The only good thing to come out of OO was polymorphism.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Scheme is an interesting exercise in austerity.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Easier&rsquo; is a dirty word in the Clojure community&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Talking about the world in a functional way is basically impossible, so I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to say these functions change values, and we&rsquo;ll all remember that what I mean is that these functions <em>don&rsquo;t</em> change values, okay?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;In an OO language, you have to put a lock on my motion to find my current position. As more and more people observe me, I actually move slower and slower!&rdquo; (on the problems with traditional OO concurrency solutions)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unrelated</strong> - The <a href="http://blog.strobecorp.com/?p=304">Strobe acquisition</a> by Facebook is interesting. I won&rsquo;t speculate on what that means for Facebook because I&rsquo;m like your grandpa when it comes to that thingamajig. However, I&rsquo;m glad to see Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz opt out of the acquisition and start their own thing. I think that speaks to the golden future ahead for SproutCore, and it would still be my framework of choice for building a rich client at the moment.</p>

  <h2><a href="/posts/2011-10-24-great-presentations">Great Presentations </a></h2>
    <section class="post-date">Monday, October 24, 2011</section>
    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wonderlane/4242150313/"><img src="http://spparker.com/images/lightsplosion.jpg" title="&quot;Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by anything.&quot; by Wonderlane" alt="&quot;Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by anything.&quot; by Wonderlane" /></a></p>

<p>I spent some quality time this weekend digging into a few presentations that I thought I&rsquo;d share with you.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/737-rubyconf2011-lightning-talk-let-s-go-to-shibuya-rubyist-lunch-at-tokyo-japan">Shibuya Rubyist Lunch lightning talk</a> from RubyConf 2011. It&rsquo;s short, about three minutes, and will set the right tone for what&rsquo;s to come. You can&rsquo;t help but feel joy when you see the enthusiasm of the audience and speaker for one another. This video encapsulates why I love the Ruby community dearly.</p>

<p>Rich Hickey&rsquo;s talk from Strange Loop 2011, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a>,&rdquo; is the best presentation I&rsquo;ve seen in years. Rich makes the case that we have abandoned the concept of &ldquo;simple&rdquo; entirely in a slavish pursuit of &ldquo;easy.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s incredibly thought-provoking - see Uncle Bob&rsquo;s follow-up, for instance. It also gives the best context yet for Rich&rsquo;s disregard for testing. Definitely have to watch this sometime - it&rsquo;s already given us a new word, &ldquo;complect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Also from this year&rsquo;s Strange Loop is Nathan Marz with <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Storm">an overview of the new Storm framework</a>. This platform for distributed real-time computation looks incredibly promising. I need to dig into this further, but this could potentially solve many different problems I&rsquo;m looking at today. It&rsquo;s not quite the brain-burner that Rich&rsquo;s talk can be, so it makes a wonderful &ldquo;cool-down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What about you? Seen any great talks lately? Planning for attending Strange Loop 2012 already?</p>
