<p>A few people have sought my advice lately on leadership. Specifically, I&rsquo;ve gotten high marks for delivering while also giving people freedom to work as they see fit. While I would caution anyone against cargo culting my practices as yours, I&rsquo;m happy to share what little I know. </p>

<p>Be advised - I don&rsquo;t pretend to be a master, merely a student.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>Beyond business strategy (which is outside the scope of this article), the goals of leadership are primarily <strong>reducing turnover</strong> and <strong>increasing productivity</strong>. Of course there&rsquo;s a number of other secondary goals that are crucially important, like fostering a great company culture and happy employees. However, I view those first two as preconditions or boons for nearly every other goal you may have.</p>

<h3 id="randsian-philosophy">Randsian Philosophy</h3>

<p>You can&rsquo;t do much better than making sure you pass <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2011/10/11/the_rands_test.html">the Rands Test</a>. Seriously, go read that right now. I&rsquo;m about to expand on a couple of his points, the two I see as the absolute bare minimum for a leader.</p>

<p>1:1 meetings may be the single most important thing you can do as a leader. Not only do you get an opportunity to address problems before they become <em>problems</em>, but they help make for super-motivated employees. When individuals can speak up and can collectively see a difference, this leads to a variety of positive outcomes, especially in preventing turnover (see <a href="http://orgsci.journal.informs.org/content/early/2012/03/15/orsc.1110.0732.abstract">&ldquo;Speaking Up vs. Being Heard: The Disagreement Around and Outcomes of Employee Voice&rdquo;</a> for more details). It&rsquo;s also an opportunity each week to relate an employee&rsquo;s personal goals to the group&rsquo;s goals and thus boost personal investment in the work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also crucial that each member of the group understands the overall mission and their role within that. This speaks somewhat to motivation, but is generally a huge productivity boost. The reason comes down to initiative.</p>

<p>Harvard Business Review&rsquo;s classic article &ldquo;<a href="http://hbr.org/product/management-time-who-s-got-the-monkey/an/99609-PDF-ENG">Who&rsquo;s Got The Monkey</a>&rdquo; (paywall w/ <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-11-26/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey-businessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice">summation here</a>) outlines the following levels of employee freedom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your employees can exercise five levels of initiative in handling on-the-job problems. From lowest to highest, the levels are:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Wait until told what to do.</li>
    <li>Ask what to do.</li>
    <li>Recommend an action, then with your approval, implement it.</li>
    <li>Take independent action but advise you at once. </li>
    <li>Take independent action and update you through routine procedure.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>For maximal productivity, you want your employees to operate at the last three levels. However, they can&rsquo;t do this effectively without a great understanding of the mission and how they play into it. Reinforcing this at every opportunity (team meetings, status updates, etc.) keeps them at those higher, more productive levels.</p>

<h3 id="two-golden-rules">Two Golden Rules</h3>

<p>When all else fails, I fall back on these two maxims: &ldquo;<strong>Manage others as I would want to be managed</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>Unblocking my team is priority #1</strong>.&rdquo; When I&rsquo;m in unknown territory, I try to imagine how I would want my own managers to treat me and go from there. I also make clear to my teams that no meeting or other priority is so important that it trumps helping them. Not only does that help keep people immediately productive, but it&rsquo;s also a motivation boost to see your team lead drop everything to help debug a problem when you are truly stuck.</p>
