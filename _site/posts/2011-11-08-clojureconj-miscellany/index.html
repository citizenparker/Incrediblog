<p>I&rsquo;m here in beautiful Raleigh, North Carolina for the second annual <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a> conference. While the conference has yet to start, the training is underway and I wanted to capture some fairly random thoughts from it:</p>

<p><strong>Rainbows</strong> - There&rsquo;s an incredible mix of programmer stereotypes present in the training. Unix wizard neckbeards, gray hair &ldquo;industrial machinery&rdquo; programmers, mainframe masters, mathematicians, and of course some of my fellow hepcat Ruby/Python slingers. Allow me to flagrantly make a broad generalization based on a small sampling of unfair stereotypes: This speaks to the  very broad appeal of Clojure. Something interesting could be happening in this community.</p>

<p><strong>Whither F#?</strong> - I frequently sigh and think fondly of F#. It had a five year headstart on Clojure, and yet there&rsquo;s no community for F# by comparison. It&rsquo;s a shame - I think it&rsquo;s a great choice for nearly any .NET project, but Microsoft continues to position it as a niche language only to be used for hard problems or math-intensive applications. Since the .NET community subsists on officially approved projects and tools from the mothership, that&rsquo;s unlikely to change any time soon. I&rsquo;d still pick Clojure over F# for most anything, but I feel for my .NET brethren who are unknowingly living in the dark ages.</p>

<p><strong>Stuart Halloway</strong> - Getting to listen to Stuart Halloway hold court during the training is golden. He brings such interesting perspectives and opinions, all of which are hard-earned and entertaining to boot. I&rsquo;ve been noting choice bits whenever I hear them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;The purpose of my training is not fact- or knowledge-transmission, but inspiration-transmission&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let you in on a secret - design patterns are evil.&rdquo; (on why Clojurists don&rsquo;t spend much time worrying about design patterns)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Like all religions, the charismatic leader was great. The followers were the problem.&rdquo; (also on design patterns)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;The only good thing to come out of OO was polymorphism.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Scheme is an interesting exercise in austerity.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Easier&rsquo; is a dirty word in the Clojure community&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Talking about the world in a functional way is basically impossible, so I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to say these functions change values, and we&rsquo;ll all remember that what I mean is that these functions <em>don&rsquo;t</em> change values, okay?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;In an OO language, you have to put a lock on my motion to find my current position. As more and more people observe me, I actually move slower and slower!&rdquo; (on the problems with traditional OO concurrency solutions)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unrelated</strong> - The <a href="http://blog.strobecorp.com/?p=304">Strobe acquisition</a> by Facebook is interesting. I won&rsquo;t speculate on what that means for Facebook because I&rsquo;m like your grandpa when it comes to that thingamajig. However, I&rsquo;m glad to see Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz opt out of the acquisition and start their own thing. I think that speaks to the golden future ahead for SproutCore, and it would still be my framework of choice for building a rich client at the moment.</p>
