When Civilization V was first released, it was a fairly disappointing product to me. The economy was very unbalanced, the AI erratic, and diplomacy was a terrible mess. It's telling that the lead designer, Jon Shafer, moved on from Firaxis not long after the game's release. However, to Firaxis' credit, they have not moved on and have instead supported the game with a steady stream of patches to address many of the initial issues.

It's well past time to revisit Civilization V and see if my opinion has changed any. Rather than a typical essay, I'll be blogging my thoughts and reactions as I play through a game. Has the game improved? Is it worthy of the name "Civilization" now, a series that includes three of my top 10 favorite games of all time? Let's find out.


## Turn 0 - Starting a New Game:
The core idea of Civilization V remains unchanged from the original 1991 game. You pick a civilization, and then lead that civilization through the ages in an effort to be the most outstanding nation in one of many ways. Civ provides ways to win through warfare, scientific research, cultural achievements, and diplomacy. 

For this game, I'll be trying something new for me and going for a cultural victory. In laymens' terms, I'll be bribing my citizens to paint paintings, write writings, and basically create a culture so rich that the rest of the world is reshaped in our image. How exactly this is accomplished and measured I'll go into later, but right now its time to pick a nation to lead.

In this, Civilization V has already made a break with tradition in a way that I really appreciate. Previous games have been careful to promote **balance**, ensuring that any nation has a decent chance against any other nation. Civilization V blatantly does not, however. Some nations have great advantages while others are pitiful
